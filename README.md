# OnTop

A simple program for `WindowsOS` that allows you to pin a window to the top of all other windows.

### Description
The program allows you to keep a window always on top.
It has options to pin an app as well (all windows of an app),
which remembers the app and automatically pin any windows open from it.


### Features
- Pin Window `(win+space)`:  Keeps a window on top of all other windows.
- Unpin Window `(win+alt+space)`:  Removes the ontop ability of a window.
- Pin Program `(win+shift+space)`:  Keeps an app (not just a window) always on top.
- Unpin Program `(win+shift+alt+space)`:  Removes the ontop ability of a previously pinned app.

`Pin Window` ability is temporary, which means it will remain only until the window is closed.  
`Pin Program` ability is sticky, it will remain in effect until the user unpin it manually.

To change the default shortcut keys, please right-click on the `OnTop` tray icon and open the `Shortcuts` menu.
